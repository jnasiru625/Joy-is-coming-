ypes of Data Change
Structural Changes

When the format, schema, or structure of your dataset changes.

Example:

A new column is added (e.g., ‚Äúpatient age group‚Äù in a health dataset).

A column name changes (‚Äúprice_usd‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúprice‚Äù).

Content Changes

The actual values inside the data are modified.

Example:

A company updates employee salaries.

New health records are added daily.

Currency exchange rates update every second.

Volume Changes

The amount of data grows or shrinks over time.

Example:

Your trading bot receives thousands of new data points every minute.

A hospital database adds new patients daily.

Concept Drift (in Machine Learning)

When the relationship between input and output changes.

Example:

A model predicting flu outbreaks might become less accurate if a new virus strain emerges.

A stock prediction model trained on past market behavior might fail if global economic conditions shift.

‚öôÔ∏è Why Data Change Matters

Model Performance:
Machine learning models can become outdated if data distributions shift. You may need to retrain or fine-tune them.

Business Insights:
In business, tracking data change reveals trends, demand shifts, and customer behavior evolution.

Health Analytics:
In health, changes in data could indicate new disease patterns, treatment outcomes, or environmental impacts.

Decision Making:
Real-time awareness of data changes supports faster, more accurate decisions in dynamic environments (like trading or hospital monitoring).

üß† How Data Scientists Handle Data Change

Data Versioning:
Tools like DVC, Git LFS, or LakeFS help track different versions of datasets.

Data Pipelines:
Automated systems (like Airflow, Prefect, or MLflow) update and monitor data regularly.

Model Retraining:
Schedule model retraining when data drift or performance degradation is detected.

Monitoring Metrics:
Track key indicators (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) to detect if your data or model is changing unexpectedly.
